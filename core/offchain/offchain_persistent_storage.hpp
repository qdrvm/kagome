   * is called) is reverted as non-canonical (meaning that the block was
   * surpassed by a longer chain). The value is available for the worker that is
   * re-run at the new (different block with the same block number) and future
   * blocks. This storage can be used by offchain workers to handle forks and
   * coordinate offchain workers running on different forks.
