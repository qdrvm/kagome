  /// nodes will pull in the same direction and work on resolving the same
  /// disputes first. This ensures that we will conclude some disputes, even if
  /// there are lots of them. While any objective ordering would suffice for
  /// this goal, ordering by age ensures we are not only resolving disputes, but
  /// also resolve the oldest one first, which are also the most urgent and
  /// important ones to resolve.
  ///
  /// Note: That by `oldest` we mean oldest in terms of relay chain block
  /// number, for any block number that has not yet been finalized. If a block
  /// has been finalized already it should be treated as low priority when it
  /// comes to disputes, as even in the case of a negative outcome, we are
  /// already too late. The ordering mechanism here serves to prevent this from
