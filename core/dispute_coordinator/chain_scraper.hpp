  ///
  /// - Monitors for `CandidateIncluded` events to keep track of candidates that
  /// have been included on chains.
  /// - Monitors for `CandidateBacked` events to keep track of all backed
  /// candidates.
  /// - Calls `FetchOnChainVotes` for each block to gather potentially missed
  /// votes from chain.
  ///
  /// With this information it provides a `CandidateComparator` and as a return
  /// value of `process_active_leaves_update` any scraped votes.
  ///
  /// Scraped candidates are available
  /// `DISPUTE_CANDIDATE_LIFETIME_AFTER_FINALIZATION` more blocks after
  /// finalization as a precaution not to prune them prematurely.
