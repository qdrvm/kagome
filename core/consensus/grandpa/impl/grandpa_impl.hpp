   * Main entry point to grandpa consensus implementation in KAGOME:
   * - starts grandpa consensus execution
   * - keeps track of current rounds
   *   - we should be able to receive votes for current and previous rounds
   * - processes incoming grandpa messages
   *   - we are checking if it is polite to process incoming messages and only then process it
   *        (see @link kagome::consensus::grandpa::RoundObserver#onVoteMessage() RoundObserver::onVoteMessage @endlink for more details)
   *  - processes rounds catch ups
   *
   * GrandpaImpl entity is registered in kagome::application::AppStateManager,
   * which executes prepare(), start() and stop() functions to manage execution of consensus algorithm
   *
   * When start is invoked we execute new grandpa round and gossip neighbour messages.
   *
   * Also we start receiving other grandpa messages over `paritytech/grandpa/1` protocol (see kagome::network::GrandpaProtocol::start()).
   * If we notice that we are lagging behind the most recent grandpa round in the network, then catch up procedure is executed (see GrandpaImpl::onNeighborMessage() and EnvironmentImpl::onCatchUpRequested()).
   * Catch up process is also described in the [spec](https://w3f.github.io/polkadot-spec/develop/sect-block-finalization.html#sect-grandpa-catchup)
   *
   * Otherwise if no catch up is needed, we proceed executing grandpa round until it is completable and previous round has finalized block
