   * (to perform very few and finite computational steps under the lock).
   *
   * An advantage over std::mutex is locking without a call to system's kernel
   * and eliminating expensive context switches.
   *
   * Can be used with std::lock_guard:
   * @code
   * spin_lock mutex;
   * {
   *    std::lock_guard lock(mutex);
   *    // synchronized computations go here
   * }
