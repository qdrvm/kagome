/**
 * Storage schema overview
 *
 * A key-value approach is used for block storage.
 * Different parts containing a block are stored in multiple storage spaces but
 * have to be addressed with the same key.
 *
 * A key is the combination of block's number concatenated with its hash. Let's
 * name it as NumHashKey.
 *
 * There is also an auxilary space named Space::kLookupKey where
 * BlockId->NumHashKey mappings are stored. Effectively there are could be two
 * types of mappings: either BlockNumber->NumHashKey or BlockHash->NumHashKey.
 * Anyways, the resulting NumHashKey is good to be used for further manipulating
 * with the Block in other storage spaces.
