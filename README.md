## Intro

KAGOME is a [Polkadot Host](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-spec/tree/master/host-spec) (former Polkadot Runtime Environment) developed by [Quadrivium](https://qdrvm.io) and funded by a Web3 Foundation [grant](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md) and Treasury proposals ( [1](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1858), [2](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/485)), [3](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/876).

## Getting Started

### Build

#### Prerequisites

If you are using a Debian Linux system, the following command allows you to build KAGOME:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qdrvm/kagome
cd kagome
sudo chmod +x scripts/init.sh scripts/build.sh

sudo ./scripts/init.sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

You will get KAGOME binary in the `build/node/` folder

Other make commands are:

```
make docker
make command args="gcc --version"
make release
make release_docker
make debug_docker
make clear
```

### Using KAGOME

#### Obtaining database snapshot (optional)

In order to avoid syncing from scratch we are maintaining the most recent snapshot of Polkadot network for KAGOME node available for anyone here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pAZ1ongWB3_zVPKXvgOo-4aBB7ybmKy5?usp=sharing

After downloading the snapshot you can extract it in the folder where the node will be running:

```
unzip polkadot-node-1.zip
```

#### Execute KAGOME Polkadot full syncing node

You can synchronize with Polkadot using KAGOME and obtain an archive node that can be used to query the Polkadot network at any state.

To launch KAGOME Polkadot syncing node execute:
```
cd examples/polkadot/
PATH=$PATH:../../build/node/
kagome --chain polkadot.json --base-path polkadot-node-1
```

> Note: If you start KAGOME for the first time, you can add the `--sync Fast` flag to synchronize using [Fast sync](https://spec.polkadot.network/#sect-sync-fast)

After this command KAGOME will connect with other nodes in the network and start importing blocks. You may play with your local node using polkadot js apps: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer

You will also be able to see your node on https://telemetry.polkadot.io/. If you need to identify it more easily you can add `--name <node-name>` flag to node's execution command and find your node in telemetry by typing its name.

Run `kagome --help` to explore other CLI flags.


#### Execute KAGOME block_validator node in development mode

The easiest way to get started with KAGOME is to run it in development mode, which is a single node network:

```
kagome --dev
```

That executes node with default accounts Alice and Bob. You can read about these accounts [here](https://kagome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/first_kagome_chain.html#launch-kagome-network).

To launch with wiping existing data you can do:

```
kagome --dev-with-wipe
```

#### Run KAGOME node in validator mode

To start the KAGOME validator:
```
cd examples/first_kagome_chain
PATH=$PATH:../../build/node/
kagome --validator --chain localchain.json --base-path base_path
```

This command executes a KAGOME full node with an authority role.

#### Run KAGOME with collator

Read [this](./examples/adder-collator) tutorial

### Configuration Details
To run a KAGOME node, you need to provide it with a genesis config, cryptographic keys, and a place to store db files.
* Example of a genesis config file can be found in `examples/first_kagome_chain/localchain.json`
* Example of a base path dir can be found in `examples/first_kagome_chain/base_path`
* To create database files, just provide any base path into `kagome` executable (mind that start with authority role requires keys to start).
