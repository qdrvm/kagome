## Intro

Kagome is a [Polkadot Runtime Environment](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-spec/tree/master/runtime-environment-spec) developed by [Soramitsu](https://soramitsu.co.jp/) add funded by Web3 Foundation [grant](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md). 


## Status

Kagome is early-stage software, you can already execute a block production process.

A simple status-report can be found within section [supported features](./README.md/#supported-features).



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For now, please refer to the [Dockerfile](./housekeeping/docker/Dockerfile) to get a picture of what you need for a local build-environment.

### Build

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/soramitsu/kagome
cd kagome

# Only needed if you forgot `--recurse-submodules` above
git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

# if you want to have full node
make kagome_full -j 

# if you want to have syncing node
make kagome_syncing -j
```



### Execute kagome full node

---
**Note**

At the moment launch from the existing db is not implemented, so you should clean up previous db before every launch using the following command from the node folder:
```
rm -rf ldb
```
---

To launch kagome full node execute:
```
cd node/
PATH=$PATH:../build/node/kagome_full/
kagome_full --genesis config/polkadot-v06.json --keystore config/keystore.json -l ldb -e
```

This command executes kagome full node which can receive extrinsics locally on port using http: `40363`. Simple transfer transaction can be sent as follows:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_submitExtrinsic", "params": ["0x290284ffdc3488acc1a6b90aa92cea0cfbe2b00754a74084970b08d968e948d4d3bf161a01e2f2be0a634faeb8401ed2392731df803877dcb2422bb396d48ca24f18661059e3dde41d14b87eb929ec41ab36e6d63be5a1f5c3c5c092c79646a453f4b392890000000600ff488f6d1b0114674dcd81fd29642bc3bcec8c8366f6af0665860f9d4e8c8a972404"]}' http://localhost:40363/
```
If transaction was successfully applied we should see the following output:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[194,108,28,60,223,55,48,163,134,182,201,23,144,126,167,123,33,119,187,164,61,50,203,175,230,189,71,245,120,104,18,38]}% 
```


### Execute kagome syncing node

---
**Note**

Same note as for full node. At the moment launch from existing db is not implemented, so you should clean up previous db before every launch using the following command from the node folder:
```
rm -rf ldb_syncing
```
---

To launch kagome syncing node execute:
```
cd node/
PATH=$PATH:../build/node/kagome_syncing/
kagome_syncing --genesis config/polkadot-v06.json -l ldb_syncing -v 1 --p2p_port 50541 --rpc_http_port 50542 --rpc_ws_port 50543
```

After this command syncing node will connect with the full node and start importing blocks.

### Configuration Details
* To execute kagome node you need to provide it with genesis config, keys and leveldb files
* Example genesis config file can be found in `node/config/polkadot-v06.json`
* Example keys file can be found in `node/config/keystore.json`
* To create leveldb storage file just provide any path into `kagome_full` executable.


### Build Kagome

First build will likely take long time. However, you can cache binaries to [hunter-binary-cache](https://github.com/soramitsu/hunter-binary-cache) or even download binaries from the cache in case someone has already compiled project with the same compiler. To this end, you need to set up two environment variables:
```
GITHUB_HUNTER_USERNAME=<github account name>
GITHUB_HUNTER_TOKEN=<github token>
```
To generate github token follow the [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). Make sure `read:packages` and `write:packages` permissions are granted (step 7 in instructions).

This project is can be built with

```
cd build
cmake -DCLANG_TIDY=ON ..
make -j
```

It is suggested to build project with clang-tidy checks, however if you wish to omit clang-tidy step, you can use `cmake ..` instead.

Tests can be run with: 
```
cd build
ctest
```
