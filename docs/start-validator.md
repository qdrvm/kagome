# Overview
This is a guide to help you set up a KAGOME node using docker-compose or service files. The guide will walk you through the process of setting up a KAGOME node on your local machine or a remote server.

## Support
For technical support, please join the [KAGOME Discussions](https://github.com/qdrvm/kagome/discussions) on GitHub.

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have the knowledge and experience to set up a server and run commands in a terminal. You will need the following software installed on your machine:

- [Ubuntu Server v24.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) or newer, installed and running on your local machine or remote server.

## Recommended Hardware Requirements

We refer to Polkadot-SDK's [reference hardware](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#reference-hardware) for running a validator node. The following are the recommended hardware requirements:

**CPU**
* x86-64 compatible
* Intel Ice Lake, or newer (Xeon or Core series); AMD Zen3, or newer (EPYC or Ryzen)
* 8 physical cores @ 3.4GHz
* Simultaneous multithreading disabled (Hyper-Threading on Intel, SMT on AMD)

**Storage**
* An NVMe SSD of 1 TB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth). An estimation of current chain snapshot sizes can be found here. In general, the latency is more important than the throughput.

* **Memory**
* 32 GB DDR4 ECC

**System**
* Linux Kernel 5.16 or newer

**Network**
* The minimum symmetric networking speed is set to 500 Mbit/s (= 62.5 MB/s). This is required to support a large number of parachains and allow for proper congestion control in busy network situations.

The specs posted above are not a hard requirement to run a validator, but are considered best practice. Running a validator is a responsible task; using professional hardware is a must in any way. 

## Setting up a KAGOME node
To set up a KAGOME node, you need to obtain the latest version of the KAGOME binary. To do so, you can build KAGOME from source, download pre-built binaries from the [KAGOME GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrvm/kagome), or install from APK packages.
Alternatively, you can use the provided docker-compose files to run a KAGOME node. If you are using docker-compose, you can skip the rest of this section and move to the Running a KAGOME node part of this guide.

### Building from source

> **Note:** By default, the project is built using `gcc`. Ensure that `gcc` is installed on your system.
> To use a different compiler, update the `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` variables with the path to corresponding compilers in the `scripts/.env` file.
> KAGOME can be built with `gcc` of version 13 or higher, or `clang` of version 16 or higher.

1. Clone the KAGOME repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qdrvm/kagome.git && cd kagome
```

2. Run installation scripts:

```sh
chmod +x scripts/init.sh scripts/build.sh # might require sudo
./scripts/init.sh # might require sudo
./scripts/build.sh
```

This will build the KAGOME binary and place it in the `build/node` directory. Ensure to add the `build/node` directory to your PATH environment variable.


### Installation from APT package

To install KAGOME releases using the provided package repository, follow these steps (tested on Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Noble Numbat)):

Update your package lists and install necessary utilities:

```sh
apt update && apt install -y gpg curl
```

Add the repositoryâ€™s GPG signing key:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://europe-north1-apt.pkg.dev/doc/repo-signing-key.gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/europe-north-1-apt-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add the KAGOME package repository to your sources list:
```sh
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/europe-north-1-apt-archive-keyring.gpg] https://europe-north1-apt.pkg.dev/projects/kagome-408211 kagome main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kagome.list
```

Update the package lists and install KAGOME:

```sh
apt update && apt install -y kagome
```

## Running a KAGOME node

Once you have the KAGOME binary installed on your machine, you can start running a KAGOME node. You can run the node using docker-compose or service files.

:::info
**Note:** To run a KAGOME validator node you need to have a node key. You can generate a node key using the ``kagome key generate-node-key`` command.
:::

:::info
**Note:** To run a KAGOME validator node you need to have a publicly accessible IP address.
:::

### Running a KAGOME node using service files

You can run KAGOME as a service using a systemd service file. Below is an example of a service file to launch KAGOME Kusama validator:

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Kagome Node

[Service]
User=kagome
Group=kagome
# LimitCORE=infinity # Uncomment if you want to generate core dumps 
LimitNOFILE=65536
ExecStart=kagome
  --name kagome-validator \
  --base-path /home/kagome/dev/kagome-fun/kusama-node-1 \
  --public-addr=/ip4/212.11.12.32/tcp/30334 \  # Address should be publicly accessible
  --validator \
  --listen-addr=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30334 \
  --chain kusama \
  --prometheus-port=9615 \
  --prometheus-external \
  --wasm-execution Compiled \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 1' \
  --rpc-port=9944 \
  --node-key 63808171009b35fc218f207442e355b0634561c84e0aec2093e3515113475624 \  # replace with your node key
  --sync Warp # recommended for the first start to quickly sync up the chain, remove it if your node is already synced

Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Adding the Service File

1. Copy the service file content into a new file named kagome.service.
2. Move the file to the systemd directory:

`sudo mv kagome.service /etc/systemd/system/`

#### Managing the Kagome Node

To start the Kagome node using systemd:
1. Reload the systemd manager configuration:
```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

2. (Optionally) Enable the Kagome service to start on boot:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable kagome
```

3. Start the Kagome service:
```sh
sudo systemctl start kagome
```

4. Check the status of the Kagome service:
```sh
sudo systemctl status kagome
```

5. To stop the Kagome service:
```sh
sudo systemctl stop kagome
```

### Running a KAGOME node using docker-compose

If you prefer running KAGOME using docker, you can use docker-compose file provided stored in KAGOME repo. To start using it navigate to folder with docker-compose.yaml file and start the node.

> **Note:** Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.

> Before starting the node, make sure to update docker-compose.yaml file with your node's key and public address.

```bash
cd housekeeping/docker-compose/kagome/
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a KAGOME node in the background. 
You can check the logs using 
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

You may connect to your local node via polkadot-js apps by using the following address: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/

To connect to graphana monitoring, use the following address: http://127.0.0.1:3000/

To stop the node: 
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Setting up session keys

Once your node is synced and running, you can set up session keys to start validating. To set up session keys, you need to invoke ``author_rotateKeys`` RPC method. You can do this using the following command:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9944
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xfdd8adfa9839d2b73b8a1be2a737ff01d41e6837415b2fcbbcb3b2795eea75877a28e58509e567c352bf074fa8990cf2635d87c897ab39862a4411c6857b900fd416403da10819c02951d9ff66001d8558f031a0ebec7114386b944d1f50c9426624937c34a92ea55c497aee3b08e85a7d5681f157f2e88e8c964a2df4a9c76bb6f48b591a4f950734df8305d493b8fc68a0defd1e31cc9d4d56ca04274e6f05"}%
```

Result field from response json is a session key. You can assign this key to your validator account using Polkadot JS. Use this guide if you are unfamiliar with the process: [link](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#bond-dot)
